- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrancescoAmbrogi
- 🎓 I am a PhD student at Queen's University, Kingston (CA)
- 💨 My research is on Turbulent Boundary Layers to investigate through mean of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- 🌱 I deal a lot with codes written in different languages. I mostly work with Fortran90/77 and Python but I 
     am currently learning Julia, having seen it's great potential.
