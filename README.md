- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrancescoAmbrogi
- 🎓 I am an adjunct professor at Queen's University and The Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston (CA)
- 💨 My research is on investigating Turbulent Boundary Layers (TBLs) under unsteady pressure gradients, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- 🌱 I deal a lot with codes written in different languages. I mostly work with Fortran90/77 and Python but I 
     am currently learning Julia, having seen it's great potential.
- 📫 If you ever need, you can reach me at ambrogifra@gmail.com
